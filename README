Helios::Panoptes version 1.51
=============================

Helios::Panoptes is the web administration interface for the Helios 
job processing system.

INSTALLATION

To install this set of modules type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

After the modules are installed, you'll need to copy the contents of 
the 'cgi-bin' directory to the cgi-bin of the web server (with 
appropriate security in place!).  

    cp -Rf cgi-bin/* /usr/lib/cgi-bin
    chmod 755 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/*.pl
    chmod 644 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/tmpl/*.html

After the cgi-bin programs and templates are installed, you'll need 
to set the HELIOS_INI env var in the web server's configuration so 
Panoptes knows where to find the global Helios settings file.
